        <div class="about-text"> <p> Hello! My name is Daeja Sutherland and I'm an illustrator, 
        comic artist, and writer. I love exploring cultural, political, 
        and social questions through fantasy illustration, and have a 
        particular obsession with orcs.  I mainly work with traditional media,
        specifically with graphite and pen. I color digitally or with watercolor 
        and pencil crayon. After finishing my thesis comic, a story about two 
        orc sisters, titled “The Back of the Orchard” I'm currently working on a 
        graphic novel about a mother and son dealing with the aftermath of a 
        failed experiment. Looking forward to connecting with you.</p></div>
